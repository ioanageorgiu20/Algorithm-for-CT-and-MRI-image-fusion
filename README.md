# Algorithm-for-CT-and-MRI-image-fusion
The proposed algorithm performs the fusion of CT and MRI medical images to improve diagnosis, using the Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) and texture energy measures (TEM). Its performance is evaluated using image quality metrics such as VIFF, SSIM, Q, and QW.
